  "summary": "The diff implements all requirements of REQ-25. The useSubmitClaim hook in useQueries.ts is fixed to handle actor-not-ready state, convert rewardAmount to BigInt to match the Motoko Nat signature, and wrap errors properly. ClaimForm.tsx wires onSuccess/onError callbacks, displays inline error messages, and shows a spinner with disabled state during isPending. The backend submitClaim signature matches the frontend call arguments.",

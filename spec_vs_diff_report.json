  "summary": "The diff implements all seven requirements (REQ-8 through REQ-14) with strong coverage. REQ-8 (logo), REQ-9 (premium design), REQ-10 (reward probabilities), REQ-11 (claim form), REQ-12 (backend), REQ-13 (confirmation), and REQ-14 (admin panel) are all present. One minor gap exists: REQ-12 specifies a query method to retrieve a single submission by coupon code, and while getSubmission exists in the backend, the admin panel uses searchByCouponPrefix for coupon search rather than an exact lookup — but the method itself is present. Overall implementation is thorough with a few minor hallucinated extras not requested by the spec.",

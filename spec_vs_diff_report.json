  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-32 and REQ-33 comprehensively. The rewardGenerator.ts has been updated with the correct weighted probability distribution and discriminated union type. ScratchCard.tsx, ScratchPage.tsx, and index.css have been updated to handle the 'better_luck' outcome gracefully. RewardReveal.tsx is conditionally rendered based on reward type. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",

Inspect the useSubmitClaim hook in useQueries.ts and the ClaimForm component to identify the exact failure point (e.g., missing or undefined actor, incorrect argument shape passed to the backend submitClaim function, type mismatch between frontend payload and Motoko actor method signature). Ensure the mutation is called with all required fields (couponCode, rewardAmount, state, city, feedback, upiId) with correct types, error boundaries are in place, and the error is surfaced to the user with a visible inline message rather than a silent failure or crash.",
